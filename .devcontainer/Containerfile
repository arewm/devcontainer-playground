# .devcontainer/Containerfile
# You can specify the Fedora version as a build argument
ARG FEDORA_VERSION=latest
FROM fedora:${FEDORA_VERSION}

# [Optional] Set a non-root user.
# The Dev Containers extension and common-utils feature often handle user creation.
# If you want to manually define a user:
# ARG USERNAME=vscode
# ARG USER_UID=1000
# ARG USER_GID=${USER_UID}
# RUN groupadd --gid ${USER_GID} ${USERNAME} \
#    && useradd --uid ${USER_UID} --gid ${USER_GID} -m ${USERNAME} \
#    && echo ${USERNAME} ALL=\(root\) NOPASSWD:ALL > /etc/sudoers.d/${USERNAME} \
#    && chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/${USERNAME}

# [Optional] Install system-wide dependencies or tools
# Update packages and install some basic tools.
# The 'common-utils' feature in devcontainer.json also handles package upgrades.
# If you are not using that feature, or need more specific control, uncomment the following:
# RUN dnf update -y && \
#    dnf install -y \
#    git \
#    procps-ng \
#    iputils \
#    sudo \
#    # Add any other essential packages your Fedora environment needs
#    # For example:
#    # make \
#    # gcc \
#    # python3-devel \
#    # java-17-openjdk-devel \
#    && dnf clean all

# [Optional] Add custom setup scripts or copy configuration files
# COPY my-custom-script.sh /tmp/my-custom-script.sh
# RUN bash /tmp/my-custom-script.sh

# [Optional] Set environment variables
# ENV MY_VARIABLE=my_value

# If you manually created a user, switch to that user
# USER ${USERNAME}

# Keep the container alive (if not using a command that keeps it running)
# This is often not needed if VS Code manages the container lifecycle or if
# your devcontainer.json has a command that keeps it running.
# CMD [ "sleep", "infinity" ]

# Note: Many common setup tasks (like creating a non-root user, installing git, zsh)
# can be handled by "features" in the devcontainer.json, which can be cleaner
# than managing them directly in the Containerfile.
# Use this Containerfile for more complex or Fedora-specific customizations
# that aren't covered by existing devcontainer features.
